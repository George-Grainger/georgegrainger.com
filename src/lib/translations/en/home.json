		"In summer I worked on the <a href=\"\">NimbleAI project</a> at the University of Manchester. This invloved designing and implementing neuromorphic accelerators for the early perception and optimisation stage for computer vision systems in power and area constrained endpoints.",
		"Overall, the experience was extremely rewarding, providing exposure to working in an iterative and test-focused development environment. The focus on low power and high performance demonstrated a need to prioritise design features to ensure the project progressed and deliverables could be achieved successfully.",
		"The internship was primarily focused on software-driven hardware implementation, however, it also developed transferable knowledge in CI/CD pipelines, Docker Containers and scripting tools. Hopefully, I'll be able to expand on this additional understanding to improve my future work and create more exciting projects in future."
