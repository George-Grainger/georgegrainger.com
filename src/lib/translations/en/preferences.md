## Accessibility

Despite focusing on animations, I want this website to be available to as many people as possible, meaning I strive for accessibility.

### What I've done

- Zoom in up to 300 per cent without the text spilling off the screen
- Navigate the website using just a keyboard
- Disable motion for those who prefer not have it
- Set the colours to meet WCAG guidelines in both dark and light modes

### Feedback and contact information

I'm always looking to improve the accessibility of this website, [contact me](/contact) if you experience:

- Issues with accessing information or using this website
- An accessibility problem
- Any positive feedback about this websiteâ€™s accessibility

## Supported languages

I currently support two languages on this website:

1. **English**
2. **French**

The reason for picking these is that they're the languages I speak best. I'm a native English speaker, and have been working hard for over a year to improve my french!.
To change your language, use the select menu in the navbar and click on the flag of the language you recognise.

### Adding more languages

If you **want to translate the site** into another language feel free to do so and I will add it. As far as I're concerned the more the merrier.

If you don't have the time to translate the site yourself let me know the language you'd like in the feedback section. If enough people agree that there's a demand **I'll add the language**.

### Spotted a mistake?

There are no doubt mistakes on my site. I'd appreciate you **letting me know** and I will work to correct mistakes. Whether you spot a typo or grammatical error let me know by [contacting me](/contact)!
