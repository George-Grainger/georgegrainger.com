## Using the site

By using the site you agree to me using your data as outlined in the [privacy policy](/privacy-policy)

## Cookies

**I care about privacy** and about being clear and transparent in how I collect and use your personal data. I use the information collected online to help me to improve your experience of visiting my website and to develop and enhance my services to you.

This policy gives you information about the cookies I use and the purposes for using those cookies.

### What is a cookie?

A cookie is a small file that websites store on your computer or mobile device. Each cookie contains anonymised information about how you use my website and applications and this allows me to improve your user experience.

### Types of cookies and what they do

The length of time a cookie stays on your device depends on its type.

I use two types of cookies on my website - _session cookies_ and _persistent cookies_

- Some cookies only exist whilst you remain on the site and are erased when you close your browser; these are known as session cookies.
- Others remain on your machine or device between sessions allowing me to recognise you when you return to the site; these are known as persistent cookies.

Broadly speaking, cookies also have four different functions and can be categorised as: -
_‘Strictly necessary’_ cookies, _‘performance’_ cookies, _‘functionality’_ cookies and _‘targeting’_ or _‘advertising’_ cookies.

You may also have heard of first and third-party cookies. Whether a cookie is _‘first’_ or _‘third’_ party refers to the website (domain) placing the cookie. **First-party cookies** are set by a website that is being visited by the user at the time. **Third-party cookies** are those set by a domain other than that being visited.

**I do not use ‘targeting’ or ‘advertising’ cookies on my site.**

Strictly necessary cookies are **essential** to navigate around a website and use its features. These cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you've been on the internet.

### Can I opt out?

The first-party cookies I use are **strictly necessary** and as a result, **it's not possible to opt out**.
