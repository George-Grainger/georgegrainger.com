**Sorry, I'm still creating the content for this page - please check back in the near future and I'll have it all finished.**

## The motivation:

The Wordle craze swept the world, but since I live under a rock, I never got properly into it. However, I really like the concept of the game as did find it fun to play from time to time. I enjoy playing puzzles and do a few most days as a hobby (and to try and wake up). 

Recently, I've also been trying to find ways to write code in Rust. Its ideas around ownership make me curious, and with memory leaks and issues with parallelism getting drilled into me during my University course units, the promise to overcome them is enchanting!

Therefore, when I saw a tutorial on making a Wordle Solver from [Jon Gjengset](https://www.youtube.com/c/JonGjengset) I thought it'd be a great opportunity to see how somebody with much greater Rust experience than me approaches a contained problem.

Ultimately having completed the tutorial, however, I felt there was potential to use this product to explore WebAssembly. This is another thing on my Rust to-do list and I thought using this model as the base for a browser extension would be perfect.

This isn't a new idea, but I didn't want the extension to just solve the game - that's kind of boring. Instead, I was after something that assisted you as you went. For those times you think you know where three of the letters go but no words then spring to mind.

Consequently, I decided I'd build this, adapting the Rust code from the tutorial to produce a Chrome extension. This helped me check out WebAssembly for Rust while providing another stream for developing my knowledge in the language, a win-win.
