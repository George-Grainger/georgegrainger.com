subtitle: An Android keyboard and associated full stack website for feedback
description: Created symput.com, a full-stack website powered by NextJS which facilitates users of my first-year group project's Android keyboard to provide feedback. The site uses Google Cloud Platform to manage user profiles and feedback posts, employing serverless functions for moderation and account data deletion. The platform remains accessible and showcases my ability to create a comprehensive green-field application.
